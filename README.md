## 🔍 Project Overview  
The car sales industry is a key driver of global economies, accounting for a large portion of automobile transactions (Onat, 2024). With the sharp rise in new car prices, the used car market is growing rapidly.  

However, challenges remain:  
- Buyers often have limited knowledge and risk overpaying.  
- Sellers may underprice or overprice their cars.  
- Financial institutions need accurate valuations for loans and risk management.  

✅ **Goal**: Build a reliable **machine learning model** and **interactive web app** to predict car prices based on features, ensuring fair and informed decisions for all stakeholders.
